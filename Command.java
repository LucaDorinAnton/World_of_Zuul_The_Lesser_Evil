 * This class is part of the "World of Zuul:The Lesser Evil" game.

 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command can consist of as many words as needed (for example: "inspect" or
 * "inventory use 3")
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <"NO_COMMAND_WORD">.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <"NO_COMMAND_WORD">.
