 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is

 * stores a reference to the neighboring room.
 * The room also has an inventory of items.
 * It can also store a GamePlay object.
 * It can also have locked rooms for which
 * the player requires a "key" in order to traverse
